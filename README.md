An Employee Management project using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring JPA, H2 database, and RESTful APIs involves creating a web application that manages employee data. 
Below is a detailed description of how you can set up and implement such a project.

##Project Overview
The Employee Management System will allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. 
The application will expose RESTful endpoints to interact with the employee data stored in an H2 in-memory database.

Technologies Used
  Spring Boot: Simplifies the setup and development of the Spring application.<br>
  Spring MVC: Facilitates the creation of web applications and RESTful services.<br>
  Spring Data JPA: Provides a simplified data access layer to interact with databases.<br>
  H2 Database: An in-memory database for testing and development purposes.<br>
  REST API: Exposes endpoints for CRUD operations.<br>
Project Structure
  Entity Class: Represents the Employee entity.<br>
  Repository Interface: Extends Spring Data JPA to provide CRUD operations.<br>
  Service Layer: Contains business logic and handles interactions between the controller and the repository.
